Hi! This is the code for my bad apple bot


Code from NPCat |
https://github.com/NPCat/bad-apple-bot

If you want to make this to work, download the zip, extract it
Then in the folder, run these commmands:
- `pip install discord.py`
- `pip install pillow`
- `pip install dotenv`

Next , you need to create a file called `.env`
