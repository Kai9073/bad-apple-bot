Hi! This is the code for my bad apple bot


Code from NPCat |
https://github.com/NPCat/bad-apple-bot

If you want to make this to work, download the zip, extract it
Then in the folder, run these commmands (in command prompt or terminal):
- `pip install discord.py`
- `pip install pillow`
- `pip install dotenv`

Next , you need to create a file called `.env`
in the .env you need to paste your token 

```env
TOKEN = YOUR.TOKEN.HERE
```

to run the bot , run this command (also in command prompt or terminal):
- `python "bad apple discord player.py"`

Make sure you have python installed on your device.

Making the bot the send the messages
1. Invite the bot to a server and give them proper permissions
2. Type `!bad apple`
3. It will start sending the messages
